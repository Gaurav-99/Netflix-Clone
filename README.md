# Netflix-Clone

  This is a frontend clone of Netflix website built using Html, CSS and JavaScript. It’s not a 
  replica of original Netflix website, and it doesn’t have all the features. It’s a similar version 
  of Netflix with my own design touch, showing my abilities in Html/CSS and JavaScript to 
  build something advanced like Netflix. It contains the home page or the landing page, signin page, 
  sign-up page, browse page, and movie player.

# Landing Page:

# Tech-Stack Used:

   HTML: Used the html to build the structure of each page
  
   CSS: Used it to design the page so as to give it a like look and feel of Netflix by using 
    different design elements.
    
   JavaScript: Used it to give each webpage a responsive nature to different events( like 
    clicks and on provided input)
    
   Visual Studio Code: Used to build, write and deploy my project locally .
  

# Approach:
  My approach in building each page of this project was simple first I created basic structure 
  of webpage using html then designed the page using CSS elements then if required used 
  JavaScript to make the webpage responsive to clicks or on provided input. The sequence of 
  development of different pages of this project are like this first I was the landing page/ 
  home page then sign-in page and sign-up page at in the was browse page.
